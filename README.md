# X-Politica üöÄ

### A Comprehensive Full-Stack MERN Application

Welcome to **X-Politica**! This project is a showcase of my expertise in designing and implementing complex systems using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application features secure authentication and authorization mechanisms and a user-friendly interface to manage and track claims and approvals.

## Why X-Politica? üåê

**X-Politica** was developed to address the need for a streamlined and secure platform for managing political claims and approvals. The application provides a robust solution for leaders and citizens to interact, ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.

### Key Features:
- **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bCrypt for password hashing, ensuring that user data is protected.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a responsive design, making it accessible on various devices.
- **User Management**: Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their claims effectively.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Users can view the status of their claims in real time, with notifications for any updates.

### Use Case Format üìã
- As a User, I can create an account as a Leader so that I can showcase myself in my area.

- As a User, I can log in so that I can make CRUD operations on my own account details.

- As a User, I can create an account as a Citizen so that I can see the claims of Leaders from my area.

- As a Leader, I can upload a claim from any area so that citizens from that area can validate it, and that claim will be shown on my portfolio.

- As a Leader, I can view stats and graphs so that I can understand my statistics and make informed decisions.

- As a Citizen, I can validate claims so that the leader receives appreciation, and it can be shown on their portfolio.
